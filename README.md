# CyberDome
Absolutely. Here’s a concept that translates the **Golden Dome missile defense** paradigm into a **cybersecurity domain** — blending **Agentic AI**, **zero-trust architecture**, and **autonomous cyber shield logic**.

## 🛡️ **"CyberDome" — Agentic AI-Driven Cyber Defense Shield**

> *A next-gen autonomous cybersecurity framework modeled on missile defense logic — shielding enterprise, cloud, and sovereign digital infrastructure using multi-agent AI coordination.*

### 🔐 **What is CyberDome?**

**CyberDome** is a **real-time, AI-orchestrated, multi-layered cyber defense system** designed to detect, isolate, counter, and neutralize digital threats before they can cause harm — just like a missile defense system intercepts incoming projectiles.

It’s powered by **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **CrewAI** agents acting as:

* 🔍 **Threat Intelligence Scouts**
* 🚨 **Zero-Day Interceptors**
* ⚔️ **Countermeasure Deployers**
* 🧠 **Strategic SOC Command Agents**
* 👨‍✈️ **Human Oversight CrewAI Layers**

### 💡 Key Features of CyberDome

| Layer                                    | Capability                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🛰️ **Threat Recon Layer**               | Scans traffic, logs, and behavior using LLM agents to identify anomalies (like “satellite recon”) |
| 🧬 **Zero Trust Enforcement Agents**     | Authenticate users, detect privilege escalations, enforce granular access                         |
| 🛑 **Intrusion Kill Chain Interceptors** | Interrupt malware execution mid-chain using autonomous detection patterns                         |
| 🧠 **AI SOC Coordination Node**          | LangGraph-based flow for correlating attack vectors and initiating response plays                 |
| 🧑‍✈️ **Human Review Board (CrewAI)**    | Inserted at critical stages to allow ethical or business rule overrides                           |

### 📦 Sample Agent Architecture

* **`ReconAgent`** – Monitors behavioral deviations across network nodes
* **`ExploitClassifierAgent`** – Classifies known/unknown exploit signatures using LLMs
* **`ContainmentAgent`** – Isolates infected endpoints via API (e.g., with Crowdstrike, SentinelOne)
* **`PolicyOverrideAgent`** – Simulates CISO or compliance officer judgment
* **`IncidentNarratorAgent`** – Summarizes the full attack timeline in plain English for rapid SOC understanding

---

### 🔐 Use Cases

* Preemptive defense against **supply chain attacks** and **zero-day exploits**
* Autonomous email & endpoint **phishing kill** operations
* Real-time **SOAR-like orchestration** using AI agent chains
* Cyber “Iron Dome” model for **critical infrastructure**, **banks**, **gov clouds**

Let’s build the **CyberDome** together — the **“Skynet for Good”** of digital defense.
